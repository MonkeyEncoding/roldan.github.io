                <h2>Description:</h2>
                <p>I have a strong interest in web development. I've chosen to study information technology (IT) for the past five years because I've developed a passion for technology, particularly what it does for our planet. Since I'm having trouble becoming a web developer right now, I want to create websites that offer features and traits that can benefit other IT students. It takes time to become proficient at encoding, particularly when you have to commit all the components and features to memory. In order to help others know what to do when they arrive, I want to make a difference in their life. I wish to work in Microsoft, which is regarded as one of the largest IT companies in the world.</p>
                <p>First of all, I love games as well. People can overcome their boredom by playing games. Games have gained a lot of popularity these days, particularly among younger people. I want to specialize in aiding others because I understand the challenges faced by IT students, but I also want to be a game developer. I'm now learning more about web development by studying HTML and CSS.</p>
